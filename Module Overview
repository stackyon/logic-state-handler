Communicating with the AI, for Rev0 we don't need to actually communicate with the server but just set up the methods.
Methods:
  get_board_state(board_state_input)
    #gets the state of the board from the GMC and keeps it in a variable 
    board_state = board_state_input
  
  get_move(board_state)
    #sends board state to AI to request move back
  
  next_move = get_move(board_state);
  
  send_move(next_move)
    #sends the move to the GMC
