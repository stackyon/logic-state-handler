== AI ==
Communicating with the AI, for Rev0 we don't need to actually communicate with the server but just set up the methods.
Methods:
  get_board_state(board_state_input)
    #gets the state of the board from the GMC and keeps it in a variable 
    board_state = board_state_input
  
  get_move(board_state)
    #sends board state to AI to request move back
  
  next_move = get_move(board_state);
  
  send_move(next_move)
    #sends the move to the GMC

== MAIN ==

== MODEL ==
Reads buffer, calls BuildMove from Movetools, returns to Main runtime loop


== MOVE ==
Object that holds movements
Ex: E1E2


== MOVEMENT ==
Object that represents at individual movement
Ex: pick up piece at E1

== MOVEMENT QUEUE ==
Buffer that holds a set of movements as a move and sends them individually to RM (as Gcode?)


== MOVE TOOLS ==
Creates moves from input from IR


== STATE CONTROLLER ==
Keeps track of the game state (Start, player, ai, gameover, incorrect[1..maxstate])
Start - game has started, no moves made yet
Player - player's turn
AI - computers turn
Gameover - game has ended
Incorrect - some error or issue has come up.
